# SegmenterParallel:
[ ] Implement more error checking (check image sizes for deviation, etc.)
[ ] Test libtorch integration

# GenerateCrops
[ ] Implement code to genreate crops from the input files of the segmenter
- Efficient implementation: Only read metadata and bounding box areas from the tif images, not the full image. 


# SinciVinci
[ ] Implement SinciVinci with the modules 


# Ideas: 
- Cross-Correlation tracking: https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.vandenboomgaard/IPCV20162017/LectureNotes/CV/Motion/CorrelationTracking.html
- stereoscopic PIV
